### My portfolio
    The project I have worked on is the start to my personal portfilio, that I will add and change as I get more projects, and a better understanding about 
    the things I am learning and improving on. Using bootstrap I built a responsive website that will also work on a range of screen sizes. Checking 
    semantic and making sure it is the correct HTML format were always kept in mind throughout the project.


### What I have learned about Bootstrap
    I learned that bootstrap is an amazing tool for a developer. You can read through how to use the utilities, content, etc.. But using it is where you greatly improve your understanding and use of certain tools. For example using the bootstrap made me understand just how to use the grid system with the rows and columns. In addition, while bootstrap doesn't show exact examples with padding and margin, with some tinkering I got a good grasp on how to use it.
