# my-portfolio

Continually changing as I get more projects, and a better understanding about the things I am learning and improving on. Using bootstrap I built a responsive website that will also work on a range of screen sizes. Checking semantic and making sure it is the correct HTML format were always kept in mind throughout the project.
